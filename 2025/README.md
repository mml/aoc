2025's attempt

Personal style/rules for this year are

  1. Complete all the work in termux on my tablet (a Galaxy Tab S9 FE+).
     Initial reason was because it is easier to code with on an airplane tray
     table, since I can put an external keyboard on my lap.  But now it's just
     a fun/interesting restriction.
  2. Primary languages are Perl 5 and Chez Scheme.  My choice, and I'll
     probably allow myself to use a different language if I want.
